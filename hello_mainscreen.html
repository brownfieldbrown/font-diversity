                    <p class="introtext">Latin-based typefaces make up the mass of fonts available on the internet, resulting in font disparities on a global scale. Of the 7,000 languages spoken throughout the world, the vast majority have to make due with poorly designed or improvised fonts. Even the world’s most spoken languages like Chinese, Arabic, Russian and Hindi have a limited choice of fonts. 
                        
                     <br><br>A tradition of designing fonts for the Latin alphabet is entrenched in the West. This orientation was somewhat understandable in the early days of digital type when the English-centric limitation of ASCII defined the technology. Today, however, Unicode has removed many of those technical restrictions. 
                        
                     <br><br>Graphic designers, particularly web and type designers, should consider language support when using or creating fonts. An abundance of well-designed typography is something all of the world deserves.</p>

                    <p class="maintext"><b>A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF FONT TECHNOLOGY</b>
                    <br><br>The digital fonts we use today have their origins in telegraph code. Telegraphs transfer message by means of encoded text, as do computers. In the early days of computers, each manufacturer had their own propriety system for encoding text. In 1961, a group of technologists came together to agree on a universal system for character encoding. The result was the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, or ASCII, which created a standardized system for character encoding. The first commercial use was by Bell data services for their teleprinters. 

                    <br><br>Given that the system was named American Standard Code, it probably comes as no surprise that it was designed to support English. Due to hardware limitations at the time, the system was limited to 128 characters, each with a standard numeric value. While this limitation allowed for a reasonable representation of the Latin alphabet, other languages weren’t served as well. An escape sequence was added to allow computers to switch from one writing system to another.

                    <br><br>The English-centric attributes of ASCII became a significant hindrance with the advent of the world wide web and the increase in global digital communications. In the late 1980s, Apple began work on Unicode which has since become the international standard. Like ASCII, Unicode assigns numbers to a font’s characters. However, Unicode extends the numbering system to more than a million characters, far exceeding ASCII’s character limitation. As a result, Unicode has the ability to support all of the world’s languages, including 80,000 Chinese characters used by a variety of Asian languages.  Despite the fact that most of today’s digital fonts are encoded with Unicode, many font developers haven’t taken full advantage of the technology and often limit their typeface designs to a few hundred characters of the Latin alphabet.

                    <p class="maintext"><b>WRITING SYSTEMS FOR THE WORLD'S OTHER 2.5 BILLION PEOPLE</b>
                    <br><br>Thousands of writing systems exist in the world today, but two thirds of the earth’s inhabitants rely on one of ten writing systems. As a result, 85% of the world’s writing systems are on the verge of vanishing — not granted official status and not taught in schools. Not surprisingly, there’s little economic incentive to develop new typefaces for these. The consequence is centuries of a culture’s accumulated knowledge is at risk of being lost.
                    <BR/ ><BR/ >Greek is one of the few exceptions. Not long after Gutenberg’s invention of movable type, Greek fonts began to appear in Europe. Noted Renaissance type designers such as Aldus Manutius and Claude Garamond designed typefaces for setting editions of the Greek classics. In the centuries that followed, elegant typefaces by Ambroise Firmin Didot among others were created.  The 11 million Greek speakers of today have the opportunity to read works set in well-designed fonts.
                    <BR/ ><BR/ >While European scholasticism ensured languages like Greek and Hebrew would find form in type, other more widely spoken languages have been left by the wayside.  Only a handful of well-designed fonts are available to communicate to the world’s 38 million Thai speakers or 22 million Laotian speakers. African languages, in particular, have been ignored. Ethiopic, for example, supports seven languages and 30 million people, and yet few Ethiopic fonts exist. For less common languages, such as Inuktitut and Cherokee, the selections are severely limited.
                    <BR/ ><BR/ >As the virtual distances between people continue to shrink due to the internet and global travel, English has become the lingua franca of the planet. While this may favor global commerce, there’s much to be lost in terms of literature and culture if we become a monolingual planet. To preserve the diversity of the world’s languages, fonts must be available to support them.

                        <br><br>Hope is on the horizon for pan-language fonts. Google is leading the charge with Noto, an ambitious type family that aims to encompass all languages covered by Unicode. To date, the Noto type family supports more than 100 writing systems and 800 languages. Included are all scripts covered by Unicode 6.0 (released in 2010), although not every character is rendered.
                        
                        <br><br>Designing a pan-language typeface is a challenging endeavor. More is involved than simply adapting Latin letterforms into new shapes. Not all scripts read from left to right, and some are rendered in cursive. Each script has subtle characteristics unique to its cultural and historical pedigree. Close collaboration with native speakers is essential to get the nuances right.

                        <br><br>Monotype, one of the world's largest type foundries, partnered with Google in the development of Noto and continues to design pan-language fonts. One notable project was for Sony who wanted a consistent type family to use across all their global markets. The result was SST which supports all 93 of Sony’s key languages in eight scripts spread across six weights and italics.

                        <br><br>Another foundry committed to designing fonts for global audiences is Typotheque. The foundry’s latest release, Ping, was designed from the ground up to facilitate global scripts. It currently supports 65% of the world’s readers with Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian and Hebrew versions available. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Devanagari versions are in the works. As Typotheque’s Peter Bil’ak states, “There are way too many fonts available for Latin only, and I see a real value in having truly international projects that explore new ground across cultures.”  </p>
